# About Phivos

I'm a platform engineer with a background in DevOps, software development, and systems design. Over the years, I’ve worked across various roles that have helped me develop a practical, hands-on approach to building and supporting reliable infrastructure.

Most recently, I’ve been part of a team at CECG, consulting for a major UK-based media company. My work focuses on supporting large-scale Kubernetes platforms, provisioning infrastructure in multi-tenant environments, and helping teams adopt self-service tools. I also help design and maintain an internal developer portal using Backstage, and provide support around CI/CD, networking, and application lifecycle practices.

Before that, I held DevOps and engineering roles at Jinius and Playtech Sports, working on infrastructure automation, observability, performance testing, and policy enforcement. These experiences gave me a solid grasp of both system-level reliability and developer experience.

I hold a degree in Computer Science from the University of Crete, where I completed a dissertation on distributed algorithms for wireless ad-hoc networks—work that was later published. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, building small tools in my spare time (like a tax calculator in Angular), and learning across a wide range of domains.

When I’m not tinkering with systems or writing code, you’ll probably find me behind a camera (especially under a starry sky) or on a backgammon board—where I humbly consider myself a grandmaster in disguise.
